Nobody’s saying men don’t get sexually assaulted in this thread. That’s not what the conversation is about.

That’s what they’re all saying here. If you say nothing you’re guilty because you won’t speak up.

If you come off as “triggered” you’re guilty because well women.

I mean I’ve seen tweets passed around by people claiming they went to college and high school with her claiming she was a slur. Which then brings up to these people just because you sleep around doesn’t mean you can’t get raped or assaulted. It’s like the word consent has a fluid meaning to these people.

Well first of all lol I’m not a fan of Hillary and even if what you say Is true, it doesn’t make what they’re doing with kavanaugh ok that’s called “whataboutism”. And I didn’t speak to his sexual assault as I don’t know all the facts. Which it seams you don’t either but you’re more than willing to come to an angry and irrational conclusion about it by immediately saying it’s a smear campaign.

Well bringing forth an allegation of assault - if it happened and if you’re accusing the right person - is admirable. I’ve been there and it’s damn hard.

If you’re not being truthful or if you have the wrong person then there’s nothing admirable about it.

> Mark Judge's ex gf says Mark Judge admitted to gang raping a drunk girl.

 Not what she said.

> Rasor says that Judge “told her ashamedly” about an incident in which he and other boys took turns having sex with a drunk woman, per the New Yorker. He seemed to think it was consensual, she added, and he didn’t name anyone else who had been involved. There is no indication that Kavanaugh was one of the boys, the New Yorker notes.

Also. 

> 
In a statement, Judge’s attorney said that he “categorically denies” Rasor’s account.

From Julie Swetnick's statement:

>In approximately 1982, I became the victim of one of these "gang" or "train" rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present. Shortly after the incident, I shared what had transpired with at least two other people. During the incident, I was incapacitated without my consent and unable to fight off the boys raping me. I believe I was drugged using Quaaludes or something similar placed in what I was drinking.

So actually, yes, Brett did rape someone.

I'm borrowing this from another comment I read from https://www.reddit.com/user/ryeander


*Do the facts make Brett Kavanaugh a likely assailant of Dr. Ford around 36 years ago?*

Dr. Ford does not recall the year, the month or day the alleged incident took place.

She does not recall whose house or street that the assault took place

She does not recall how she got there, or how she got home

She does recall having just one beer at the party

She recalls four other people at the party: Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, Patrick PJ Smith, Leland Keyser (whom she claims is her lifelong friend). Kavanaugh/Smith/Judge/Keyser have all issued statements *under penalty of perjury*, that they do not recall attending any such party, or any assault taking place.

Dr. Ford stated that she revealed details of her assault to her therapist in May 2012. The therapist’s notes told her there were “four boys” in the bedroom, not two as she has stated. The notes do not name Kavanaugh. The notes also indicate Ford said she was in her late teens when she was assaulted. But Ford now says she may have been only 15.

Neither Dr. Ford’s parents nor her two siblings have come out to voice support for Ford, and they did not sign any family letter of support vouching for her credibility.

Her husband’s family members did come out with a signed letter of support.

A polygraph was performed. The examination was administered by former FBI agent Jeremiah Hanafin in a Hilton hotel in Maryland. It appears that Hanafin worked off a handwritten statement that Ford signed. That statement refers to “4 boys and a couple of girls” at the party. That is different from her account to the Committee that the party consisted of “me and 4 others.” The only two “relevant” questions asked by Hanafin “Is any part of your statement false?” and “Did you make up any part of your statement?” *He did not ask specific questions on whether she was assaulted by Kavanaugh.*

Kavanaugh’s own calendar backs up her story more than his.  July 1st, 1982.  Timmy’s house.  Small gathering for ‘skis’ with the people Ford said was at the small gathering where the drunken assault happened.

Actually Keyser said she didn't remember the party specifically, but she believes Ford on the events in question. Which isn't unsurprising, I'm sure the event was not particularly different than any of a number of high school parties if you weren't being assaulted.

Burden of proof falls on the accuser. Especially for serious allegations, such as sexual assault. We should trust claims in order to verify the accusations, rather than discard them from the start, but we should NOT assume guilt first before innocence is proven. 

I ask that you put yourself in the shoes of the accused. How would you react if someone claimed you did a heinous crime, with only the following facts?

****Do the facts make Brett Kavanaugh a likely assailant of Dr. Ford around 36 years ago?****


* Dr. Ford does not recall the year, the month or day the alleged incident took place. 

* She does not recall whose house or street that the assault took place

I don't agree.  You're only lying if you *know* what you are saying is false.

&#x200B;

Ford has a "recovered" memory.  There have been many cases of recovered memories not being accurate.  There are also many cases of regular memories being false years later.

&#x200B;

Ford could be truthfully telling what she remembers, yet what she remembers is not what happened.

&#x200B;

In that case, neither would be lying.

Brett Kavanaugh Fun Fact: Sources close to the Kavanaugh family have released a statement discussing how Brett would always flip rolls of toilet paper so that the TP would be pulled under and not over the roll

10: (0.811)

How about facts.

1. Back when the alleged ASSAULT occurred, it was one year.

2. She wasn't raped. She wasn't even allegedly raped. She never even stated she was raped. She was allegedly groped which is at best being molested. Which is assault. 

11: (0.799)

Those therapist notes have been proven inaccurate. There are more than a few holes in the polygraph as evidence claim. As far as she told many people about this incident, if I recall only her husband has stated that she named Kavanaugh prior to her letter to the senator.

Subreddit id = t5_2r2jt

They have actually already talked to everyone she claims was at the party, and all of them denied being at such a party, even her female friend. 

16: (0.756)

No she was not raped and she never said she was raped.  She said she escaped being raped.  That doesn't mean she was not sexually assaulted.  She was and luckily got away.

The fact that her therapist confirmed she talked about it years ago, that her husband confirmed she’d told him about it years ago, and that she passed a polygraph (the least strong of the three given polygraph exams being not that reliable).

Interviewer: “Please tell me your story Mrs. Ford. “

Ford: “Kavanaugh, did it, he sexually assaulted me in high school.”

Interviewer: “Did you just tell me that Mr. Kavanaugh sexually assaulted you in high school. “

Ford: “Yes”

Interviewer: looks at results “she’s telling the truth.”

I don’t think shes an expert, either. Her [‘about me’ webpage](https://bombardsbodylanguage.com/about/) was about her intentions but not her qualifications with an emoji. Wouldn’t a professional have her own educational medical channel with all her videos available with a biography. She does make a note that the comments are her opinion but not professional opinion. I still don’t think she’s a certified behaviorist. Her syntax is very informal so It really just seems like a hobby. And you have to pay to see some of her videos. I believe she’s would be violating her ethics if she were a behavioral analyst.

Edit: a few words and a link to the certified behavioral analyst that was mentioned in a parent comment.

He may sound like a raving lunatic, but a study found that a statistically insignificant (meaning within the study's margin of error, but barely) amount of liberals were found to have slightly higher iqs than the average. Topped with another study I read from years back that said that people with high iqs tend to have more mental illness than the average.

Depending on how lucky the woman was in her birth date, over the past 150-200 years the treatment for hysteria was indeed to have a medical doctor masturbate the lady to an orgasm, or just do a cliterodectomy and labiaectomy, or insert an ice pick through her eye socket, ~~tap that frontal lobe gently~~ whack that frontal lobe vigorously a couple of times, and the lady would be right as rain.

Liberals tend to be atheistic, they tend to be more open to changing their worldview, they (sometimes) exhibit signs of mental illness. They also tend to have a higher iq than your average Republican, but it was within the study's margin of error barely. People who have a higher iq are significantly more likely to exhibit signs of mental illness than your average (in terms of iq) person. Take Einstein for example he displayed symptoms of being manic depressive. I happen to be a high functioning autistic with a savant ability in memory (I can almost instantly recall anything I've read). I happen to be left leaning because I believe we should all work together toward making the most amount of people happy that we can.

Fun fact: the word "hysteria", meaning an uncontrollable surge of emotion, comes from the Greek word for Uterus. (which is also why a hysterectomy is called that) The use of the word for uterus is a strong indicator that the idea of uncontrolled emotion is found only, or primarily, in women. The term was used historically to refer to excess emotion in women.

&#x200B;

From Wikipedia:

While the word "hysteria" originates from the Greek word for [uterus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus), *hystera* (ὑστέρα), the word itself is not an ancient one, and the term "hysterical suffocation" – meaning a feeling of heat and inability to breathe – was instead used in ancient Greek medicine. This suggests an entirely physical cause for the symptoms but, by linking them to the uterus, suggests that the disorder can only be found in women.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteria#cite_note-gilman1993-1) Historically, hysteria was thought to manifest itself in women with a variety of symptoms, including: [anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety), shortness of breath, [fainting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fainting), [insomnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia), [irritability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritability), nervousness, as well as sexually forward behaviour.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteria#cite_note-maines-2)

If you are pro-choice, now is the time to reach out to your Senators.  In my opinion, your best options is [5 Calls](https://5calls.org/) (site takes a minute to load).  They give you the relevant numbers based on your location and a script to use.  You can adjust the script for yourself to make it more natural, but at least your have a guideline.  The site takes a minute to load, so don't navigate away right away if it doesn't seem to be working.  Calls during east coast business hours generally lead to a conversation with a staff assistant, calls outside of east coast business hours usually lead to voicemail.

Right now, there are multiple scripts for Kavanaugh:  [DEMAND JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THOROUGHLY REVIEW ALL KAVANAUGH DOCUMENTS](https://5calls.org/issue/judiciary-committee-review-kavanaugh-documents) /// [BLOCK BRETT KAVANAUGH TO PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS](https://5calls.org/issue/brett-kavanaugh-voting-rights) /// [OPPOSE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT KAVANAUGH FOR HIS HOSTILITY TO REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS](https://5calls.org/issue/oppose-kavanaugh-reproductive-rights) /// [PROTECT THE SPECIAL COUNSEL: VOTE NO ON KAVANAUGH](https://5calls.org/issue/special-counsel-brett-kavanaugh) (links take a minute to load).

His potential employer hasn't accused him of anything. His potential employer is the President of the United States who has been actively promoting his confirmation.

Ten days for a nomination hearing is nothing. One nominee had to endure two years of debate.

This guy is going to be employed for life.  It's worth finding out how he behaves, drunk or sober.

*According to federal statute, the Court normally consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Once appointed, justices have lifetime tenure unless they resign, retire, or are removed from office.*

It's over a SC seat though. This is about whether he gets to be one on nine people deciding law for all of us or if he's merely going to be a federal judge. Denying him a seat is no more an injustice than denying anyone else a seat. There's no standard of evidence needed to not seat him, a senator could vote against him because they didn't like his tie. We don't need to prove he did it, we don't even need to show it's likely it happened. The Supreme Court should be above suspicion.

There is significant corroborating evidence, and Kavanaugh has not been charged with a crime.  No one's trying to prosecute him.  No one's even trying to take away his lifetime appointment to the federal bench (yet, but I hope they will).  

Most troublingly, and why he must withdraw or be withdrawn, is that this will not end.  if he is placed on the supreme court, the investigation will continue by those that want to know more.  More evidence will be discovered.  More accusations will likely come forth.  It will grow.  And then we will probably end up with the second impeachment of a supreme court justice in the history of this nation, and regardless of the outcome it will be a great stain from which we may not ever properly recover.

Have you called your Senators and told them how you feel?  It is incredibly important that people reach out directly to their Senatiors right now.  Posting on Reddit or tweeting about the situation means nothing without direct, polite contact with your Senators.  They're the people who make the decisions.

If you are a US voter concerned about Kavanaugh- **call your Senators.**  It doesn't matter who your Senators are, they all should hear from constituents right now.  And having to talk to real live people makes an impact on the people working in the office.

I like 5 Calls.  They give you a script and all the phone numbers you need.

Or more logically it’s a damn job interview and ANY candidate who IS a sitting judge should a. Refrain from open partisanship since it’s a scotus seat and b.

A) It hasn't derailed anything yet, he's still widely expected to be confirmed to the Supreme Court. Democratic Senators and others are now calling for Republicans (who control the process) to delay his nomination so that they can question Brett Kavanaugh about this.

B) Supreme Court justices are quite possibly the most powerful people in the country behind the President. As a result, people nominated to those positions receive *incredibly* more scrutiny than an average judicial position.

C) When a woman publicly accuses someone who currently nominated for a lifetime position as a judge of having tried to rape her, *even if it was a long time ago,* that's something that a lot of people think should be investigated and considered *before confirming that person to a lifetime tenure as a judge.* And especially because once that person is on the bench, they can only be removed by a 2/3 vote of the Senate following a messy and long impeachment trial, as opposed to the majority vote required to put them on the bench in the first place.

In Maryland, persons aged between 14 and 16 may consent to sex as long as the other partner is not more than 4 years older, so it's not anything like statutory if they did have any kind of sex.

Their age does not excuse the behavior. 

Being hormonal does not excuse the behavior. 

Being an "awkward teenager" does not excuse the behavior. 

High School aged boys are not idiots and should know that holding people down and covering their mouths in an attempt to have sex with someone is wrong on all levels. It's rape, or in this case attempted rape. You can "explore you sexuality" with consent, and this encounter was clearly not consensual.

But they know that not every boy acts that way. It’s a shitty boys who don’t need to fear repercussions or consequences.saying “what boy hasn’t done that in high school” is just a way for them to excuse the men and boys they want to protect while abandoning the people they have no use for.

That won't stop the right from tripping over themselves to defend Bret because when it comes down to it the truth is the right loves rape and pedophilia and have a history of defending those acts and endorsing the attackers while attacking the victims.

His was a textbook presentation of [DARVO](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10926771.2017.1320777) (Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender)

>Perpetrators of interpersonal violence thrive when victims are silenced. Most perpetrators never face legal repercussions for their abusive actions and many victims stay silent about their traumatic experience for extended periods of time or choose never to disclose for multiple reasons, including fear of retaliation and not being believed. Despite the plethora of research on reasons for victim non-disclosure or delayed disclosure, there has been very little focus on how perpetrators may actively discourage their victims from disclosing. Perpetrator demands for silence may in fact negatively affect victims’ willingness to disclose interpersonal abuse. Freyd proposed that perpetrators employ a particular three-part strategy in order to silence victims and escape culpability: deny or minimize the abuse, attack the victim’s credibility, and assume a victimized role (i.e., “play the victim”). The elements of this strategy are captured by the acronym DARVO: Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. Freyd conceptually linked these particular responses and suggested that this set of perpetrator reactions to being confronted or held responsible for harmful behavior would produce confusion and non-disclosure on the part of the victim.

(seriously, read the [full text free!] study linked. It's illuminating. Especially if you're someone who can't understand why people don't report this stuff)

Maybe he shouldn't have raped somebody, then he could keep his daughter better sheltered from the world he's creating for her.

She was thinking about going public, later decided it probably wasn't worth it, then somebody leaked the story and everything else came with it.

*She could of kept it confidential and still brought it to the SJC to be investigated. She could of sent a letter to the FBI and kept it confidential.*

Facts are she didn't, she didn't even ask him in the 1v1 interview they had.

There are 2 people who could of leaked the letter blowing up her confidentiality.
They are Feinstein, and Ford herself.

In fact there is an [investigation](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/30/cotton-feinstein-ford-leaked-letter-854019) on Feinstein's office to determine if she leaked it.

Edit: Also that article cites a Bar investagion on Ford's lawyers. They were recommended by Feinstein.

So she comes forward with this in July. We go through the entire nomination hearings, where thousands of documents are presented and questioned, and it's not mentioned or brought up once? It's not even hinted at until after the hearings. Then it's bright forward when it's clear he's going to be confirmed. 

That's not fishy. Ok. Keep those blinders on.

If you watched the hearing you'd know that Feinstein respected Dr. Ford's wish for privacy, confident her office didn't leak the info. It likely came from a friend of Dr. Ford (she admitted that she told multiple friends if contacting Feinstein's office), at which point, Dr. Ford & Feinstein went public.

How is that a head scratcher?

Does something about a polygraph magically equal public announcement of who you are? They seem like completely separate things.

Now if "she went public" but "wished to remain anonymous" that would be a head scratcher because those two things are mutually exclusive. Taking a polygraph and remaining anonymous to the public are not mutually exclusive.

She reported this months ago, and it's taken that long for the allegations to become public. She had actually given up, and the allegations ended up leaking and forcing her to come public:

>She contacted The Post through a tip line in early July, when it had become clear that Kavanaugh was on the shortlist of possible nominees to replace retiring justice Anthony M. Kennedy but before Trump announced his name publicly. A registered Democrat who has made small contributions to political organizations, she contacted her congresswoman, Democrat Anna G. Eshoo, around the same time. In late July, she sent a letter via Eshoo’s office to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.

>In the letter, which was read to The Post, Ford described the incident and said she expected her story to be kept confidential. She signed the letter as Christine Blasey, the name she uses professionally. 

>Though Ford had contacted The Post, for weeks, she declined to speak on the record as she grappled with concerns about what going public would mean for her and her family — and what she said was her duty as a citizen to tell the story.

>She engaged Debra Katz, a Washington lawyer known for her work on sexual harassment cases. On the advice of Katz, who believed Ford would be attacked as a liar if she came forward, Ford took a polygraph test administered by a former FBI agent in early August. The results, which Katz provided to The Post, concluded that Ford was being truthful when she said a statement summarizing her allegations was accurate.

>By late August, Ford had decided not to come forward, calculating that doing so would upend her life and probably would not affect Kavanaugh’s confirmation. “Why suffer through the annihilation if it’s not going to matter?” she said.

>Her story leaked anyway.

Why do you assume the Democrats on the committee have anything to do with the leak?  The letter itself didn't seem like it was leaked, since we haven't seen the letter.  Ford admitted to telling friends about the letter and allegations though.

12: (0.641)

I’m playing devils advocate, but Ford specifically wanted to keep her name private. Feinstein, it could be argued, was attempting to do so. IIRC, Ford even talked about she only came forward publicly once she started being hounded by reporters and realized her name was going to be published regardless.

"The Democrats" in this instance means two Congresspersons, who were the representatives of the alleged victim.  Senator Feinstein only released it after the press reported on the issue.  It was not the strategy of the  Dems on the Judiciary committee for this to become public.

I implied the opposite of a conspiracy.  I said only that her timing was bad.  It would have been advantageous for Feinstein to release it earlier so that the nomination wouldn't have gotten out of committee.   Waiting this long was bad for everyone, not part of a "plan".   Feinstein ultimately didn't grant the privacy, so if she was going to release it anyway it should have been from the start.

The FBI is not investigating him. Dianne Feinstein received the letter this summer apparently, has SAT on it, and just now releases it right smack in the middle of the hearings. Awfully good timing to release the letter both on the person writing it and on Feinstein releasing it just now.

My question is how was the LETTER leaked. The letter that was supposedly sent only to feinstein was leaked before they went public. Plus ford specifically states that she never mentioned Kavanaugh’s name. It seems pretty suspicious to me at least. On top of all of this Feinstein started to stumble around when asked about her staff (yes she did say she asked her staff if they leaked it but it wasn’t that convincing) I feel bad for both parties I feel like both probably believe what they are saying

I’m sure there are altruistic aspiring politicians. Of course there are. But I do believe it is a very small minority. 

Plus, I disagree with your main point that the public is smarter than the individual. I think it is the exact opposite currently.  

And also, I believe the media is driven by money. And unfortunately, the way it is currently being presented is BECAUSE this type of media is what gains viewers. This is what the public wants. 

That is why all faith has been lost completely in the system. I am glad that people like you exist and are optimistic about it. But to me, it is broken.

Frankly I dont care whether you like me or not, and all I did was disagree with you.  My opinion doesn't have to be liked or well received but I'll defend it nonetheless.  Instead of trying to tell me what I'm saying is "false" maybe you should try and change people's mind, get them to see it from your perspective.  Its helluva lot more effective.  And no one here is "wrong" we simply have differing views.  I never once attacked yours, but only offered a different way of seeing things. But that doesn't mean you should try to insult me.

I would agree with that theory. 

The problem is I truly believe that a person who pursues a career in politics is usually (and not always, but I’d wager the vast majority) wealthy, entitled, and more thirsty for power than trying to ‘change the status quo’.   Unfortunately the system has been set up to reward that type of a person. And because if this, the further up you go, those qualities are even stronger and more prevalent. 

And personally, people with those qualities are NOT my favorite type of people. But meanwhile, they are the ones I have to choose between when I elect my representatives. It really is a shame.

This is not revision at all my friend. Here is Abraham Lincoln on the founding fathers and their take on slavery:

The argument of "Necessity" was the only argument they ever admitted in favor of slavery; and so far, and so far only as it carried them, did they ever go. They found the institution existing among us, which they could not help; and they cast blame upon the British King for having permitted its introduction. BEFORE the constitution, they prohibited its introduction into the north-western Territory---the only country we owned, then free from it. AT the framing and adoption of the constitution, they forbore to so much as mention the word "slave" or "slavery" in the whole instrument. In the provision for the recovery of fugitives, the slave is spoken of as a "PERSON HELD TO SERVICE OR LABOR." In that prohibiting the abolition of the African slave trade for twenty years, that trade is spoken of as "The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States NOW EXISTING, shall think proper to admit," &c. These are the only provisions alluding to slavery. Thus, the thing is hid away, in the constitution, just as an afflicted man hides away a wen or a cancer, which he dares not cut out at once, lest he bleed to death; with the promise, nevertheless, that the cutting may begin at the end of a given time. Less than this our fathers COULD not do; and NOW [MORE?] they WOULD not do. Necessity drove them so far, and farther, they would not go. But this is not all. The earliest Congress, under the constitution, took the same view of slavery. They hedged and hemmed it in to the narrowest limits of necessity.

In 1794, they prohibited an out-going slave-trade---that is, the taking of slaves FROM the United States to sell.

In 1798, they prohibited the bringing of slaves from Africa, INTO the Mississippi Territory---this territory then comprising what are now the States of Mississippi and Alabama. This was TEN YEARS before they had the authority to do the same thing as to the States existing at the adoption of the constitution.

In 1800 they prohibited AMERICAN CITIZENS from trading in slaves between foreign countries---as, for instance, from Africa to Brazil.

In 1803 they passed a law in aid of one or two State laws, in restraint of the internal slave trade.

In 1807, in apparent hot haste, they passed the law, nearly a year in advance to take effect the first day of 1808---the very first day the constitution would permit---prohibiting the African slave trade by heavy pecuniary and corporal penalties.

In 1820, finding these provisions ineffectual, they declared the trade piracy, and annexed to it, the extreme penalty of death. While all this was passing in the general government, five or six of the original slave States had adopted systems of gradual emancipation; and by which the institution was rapidly becoming extinct within these limits.

Thus we see, the plain unmistakable spirit of that age, towards slavery, was hostility to the PRINCIPLE, and toleration, ONLY BY NECESSITY

Democrat judges voted to ban sawed of shotguns for not being useful in a militia. This passed.

Democrats judges voted guns like the AR-15 were exempt from civilian ownership since they were intended for use in a militia, and since we dont have a militia, we dont need AR-15s. This did not pass.

But point being, these two beliefs cannot coexist. The 2nd amendment is clearly defined in it's own words and any interpretation by a judge is a bastardization to suit themselves. Problems like this should not arise.

I have never really understood their ilk. Yes, I consider the constitution a sacred document, but not an infallible one; Constitutionalists seem to see it as actually being /divine/, unquestionable and untouchable.

The law is a tool.  It does not exist on its own, it exists to serve a purpose.  An enlightened civilized society would be able to bend the law when it no longer served that purpose.  Unfortunately, conservatives, especially American conservatives, see law as an end in itself.

The US constitution actually doesn't contain an explicit right to judicial review; 40 years after some justice just said it would be there and the legislative didn't challenge it and now it's gone on for too long to challenge it; the US was indeed one of the first to did that.

Other countries followed and some as a reaction including my own explicitly banned it because they felt it would turn the courts political rather than neutral..

There still seem to be two schools of thought regarding constitutions whether they should be clear and technical or vague and political though; my own constitution is really mostly concerned with how the state operates and doesn't really contain much about rights and stuff which is just in the law itself; there's as said no judicial review either.

Other constitutions have these weird "philosophies" in their constitution like defining official state ideologies or languages which for the most part here is just in the actual _law_ itself, not the constitution which covers the mechanism by which new laws are created.

And Republican justices, with their fifty year majority, have also upended precedent consistently to give corporations all the power over employees, customers, and citizens. They've in fact given corporations every benefit, and then some, that a citizen has, while removing from corporations all responsibility.

>the weren't intended to be backseat legislators who "interpret laws",

.... the job of a judge is to interpret the law. Just because they interpret in a way you don't like doesn't mean that they're not interpreting the law.

Law is subjective. Interpretation of law is far more an art than a science. I strongly encourage you to take some time to read through some important Supreme Court cases where there are split decisions, 5-4 or 6-3, at the very least something with a majority opinion and one or more dissents or concurrences. Read through the arguments, see how each side presents a persuasive vision of what the same set of words "says."

Edit: The example I always give is the Eighth Amendment, which reads in full: "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." How that Amendment is interpreted is massively subjective. How much bail is "excessive bail?" How large a fine is an "excessive fine?" What is "cruel" punishment? What is "unusual" punishment? All of these questions are inherently subjective and different judges can come to wildly different conclusions about what the answers are, *and there is no way to say objectively who's right.* It all comes down to whose answer gets the most votes at the time.

The law should be interpreted as written, and as it was understood when it was written, And I don’t think that’s a bad thing.

The cool thing about our system of government is that we have peaceful ways of changing what the law says.

I wish we were more willing to update our laws to reflect current human context. 

Instead of doing the hard work of persuading fellow citizens that the law should be changed, too many people want to instead twist the truth about what a law really means or was intended to mean in order to get their desired outcome through the courts.

I wish we could all be honest and just legislate the changes we want through the processes we already have. If a majority of the citizenry doesn’t want them changed then we should leave the law as it is, not try to manipulate how it is interpreted through the courts.

TS SAR SCI almost always requires poly, TS SCI w/ poly is also an established level of clearance for working within the IC. Non IC work, like DOD - 24th AF and TS SAR SCI work usually doesn’t require a poly, just the chance you may have to provide one.

Also, Polys come in two flavors, full scope, or CI. One of them is “any question is allowable” the other is 6 questions which surmount to “are you a spy”

Plus, in the report I read she was asked two distinct questions only, which isn’t how polygraphs are administered.  The administrator is to first establish a baseline by asking general questions of which the answer is already known.  Only asking two questions fails to do much if anything.

The 2 Question Polygraph that literally asked her if she was lying or nah? That one? That's good enough to destroy a man's life? You do know polygraph tests don't actually determine if you're telling the truth or not, right? They read your physiological responses, such as pulse, heart rate, whatever. There Is No evidence that proves that any one physiological response can show deception. This is why polygraph tests are NOT admissible in court. They are not accurate and they mean less than nothing.

The only actual utility a polygraph has is as a tool of intimidation, the science behind it is junk.

8: (0.742)
Subreddit id = t5_2r2jt
Submission id = t3_9j5eb5

The accuracy (i.e., validity) of polygraph testing has long been controversial. An underlying problem is theoretical: There is no evidence that any pattern of physiological reactions is unique to deception. An honest person may be nervous when answering truthfully and a dishonest person may be non-anxious. Also, there are few good studies that validate the ability of polygraph procedures to detect deception. As Dr. Saxe and Israeli psychologist Gershon Ben-Shahar (1999) note, "it may, in fact, be impossible to conduct a proper validity study." In real-world situations, it's very difficult to know what the truth is.

A particular problem is that polygraph research has not separated placebo-like effects (the subject's belief in the efficacy of the procedure) from the actual relationship between deception and their physiological responses. One reason that polygraph tests may appear to be accurate is that subjects who believe that the test works and that they can be detected may confess or will be very anxious when questioned. If this view is correct, the lie detector might be better called a fear detector.

Some confusion about polygraph test accuracy arises because they are used for different purposes, and for each context somewhat different theory and research is applicable. Thus, for example, virtually no research assesses the type of test and procedure used to screen individuals for jobs and security clearances. Most research has focused on specific incident testing. The cumulative research evidence suggests that CQTs detect deception better than chance, but with significant error rates, both of misclassifying innocent subjects (false positives) and failing to detect guilty individuals (false negatives).

Research on the processes involved in CQT polygraph examinations suggests that several examiner, examinee, and situational factors influence test validity, as may the technique used to score polygraph charts. There is little research on the effects of subjects' differences in such factors as education, intelligence, or level of autonomic arousal.

Evidence indicates that strategies used to "beat" polygraph examinations, so-called countermeasures, may be effective. Countermeasures include simple physical movements, psychological interventions (e.g., manipulating subjects' beliefs about the test), and the use of pharmacological agents that alter arousal patterns.

The polygraph was invented in an effort to determine if one has hypertension. 

Polygraphs do not detect lies and the concept that they do was created mostly by Hollywood who ran with the idea after law enforcement experimented with it. Sadly all the science proved it is not effective in proving lies but Hollywood still ran with the idea. This is why most people think they work. 

Now because most people believe the Hollywood lie. Attorneys do stoop to the level of using them to persuade juries. The lie detector itself is not allowed as evidence however attorneys will use it as arguments for the jury such as "oh they didn't take it they must be hiding something or lying" or "they took the polygraph and it proves they aren't lying" to which most people have been conditioned to believe Hollywood. 
In the end science doesn't like but polygraphs do when it comes to using it for it's unintended use for detecting lies. I don't recall it even working to discover hypertension.

Your statement is not accurate.  The polygraph *detected no evidence of deception* which means the polygraph could not prove she was lying.  It does NOT mean she was telling the truth, polygraphs are highly unreliable and people can easily fake them. That is why they are not accepted as reliable evidence.

They will, and they have.  I don't think that's disputed. Both sides want to confirm Justice's that lean more towards their values. 

This can't really be disputed when party lines say they will vote no on any justice a President picks before the nominations are announced. Democrats did that with Neil and Brett (before they were announced) and Republicans did that (in essence) by saying we won't hold a vote (effectively voting no while holding majority) for Merrick (before Obama announced him). So I don't think it is a "should we pack the courts", it is a "when we pack the courts".

At least, that's my take on it.

I went back to double check and I did math wrong. It was 9 months, my bad. Merrick Garland nomination remained before the Senate for 293 days.  9.6 months. I started by playing semantics now I'm trapped! ?

It wasn't their seat. It required a majority Senate vote and Republicans controlled the Senate. Sure, some may have votes across the aisle but we don't know that and it seems in this political environment it is unlikely. Regardless, you can't say Democrats, by right, should have had that seat when the opposition controlled the majority required to confirm.

3: (0.831)

You have to look at the situation. Merrick was a moderate left acceptable over some further left potentials. However, the GOP realized they didn't need to accept moderate left because they could delay until a moderate right was nominated. 

Democrats are doing the same thing, if midterms were over they would accept a moderate right nominee as the best of the "worst" (meaning any justice that's right leaning). Now they see a chance to delay until midterms and the potential opportunity to force a moderate left nominee.

I dunno man, I see this as two methods to accomplish the same goal. It's about stifling the other side.

Obama nominated Garland a full month after the senate had already said that they would not be holding a vote for SCOTUS during the election year. He wasn't denied a trial after. The senate said this BEFORE Obama nominated anybody. Obama did it anyway, knowing that they already said they were not going to consider one.

This argument is completely stupid. Nobody knew in March who was going to win the election in the fall. Hillary could have won and she would have gotten to pick and they would have held a vote then.

The ability to prevent a confirmation if both parties did not agree to the nomination is the reason why this administration has eliminated the rule that if there is a threat of filibuster, the vote must have 60/100 senators’ approval.

I was just arguing with some people about a Democratic vote on a tax bill. 3 Dems crossed the line to let it pass. "Just enough to win -- like always" they quipped.

Sure, it's messy and there are phonies - but the only way to get politicians to act how we want them to is to reward those who pay lip service to our demands and punish those who don't. We should do more kickstarters that fund the opposition or go with the candidate when they vote the way we want them to.

How do religions take over? They burn the heretics. Who cares what Democrats think or why they vote. If we destroy the lives of the 3 that voted for the Republican tax bill, then it won't matter.

You won't answer my question, which is very interesting. You're just saying "women do bad things too!" As if that makes men sexually assaulting women okay. 

A woman being a stripper is not comparable to sexual assault unless she gives a non consensual lap dance, and if a man paid for it then chances are he is consenting. That you think it is reveals much about how you see women.

No, sexual assault doesn't follow deductively from a drinking problem, but I'm not using deduction but abduction. The thing is that violent drunkards are more likely to sexually assault women than sober, nonviolent people. If you have a violent drunkard who's accused of sexual assault by three different women, these allegations are more likely to be true than if it's a sober, nonviolent person who's being accused. Being a violent drunkard reduces your credibility. This is the way detectives work. If you have a murdered person, who's more likely to be the suspect: his sober, calm friend, or his drunk, violent friend? Your assertion that a drinking problem means next to nothing if we're working from the assumption of innocence rather than guilt is simply false. It means a lot.

And I'm not sure how many times I have to point this out, but here's an undeniable fact: if we were talking about a different crime than sexual assault, we wouldn't be debating whether Kavanaugh's guilty. If he were accused of being a violent drunkard by one person, and of beating up three men by three different men, and if we had his own admission that he had a drinking problem at that time, we wouldn't be debating whether he's guilty. But because this is about women being raped, suddenly, everything's different. You know this. I know this. Somehow, by default, we assign more credibility to men than to women. The second this is about a woman being sexually assaulted and not a man being assaulted, we begin to play these games and say that the woman has no idea what she's talking about. But if this were about Kavanaugh being accused by men, we wouldn't be debating whether he's guilty; we'd be debating whether this should be enough to disqualify him.

To be on the SCOTUS, you're supposed to be rational & refusing to answer questions, trying to lecture people, acting like going to a good college means he couldn't have done it, is crazy. He refused to answer about half the questions, even asked a Senator one of the questions that he refused to answer. I don't know any job that would be okay with it.

It is a simple fact that Kavanaugh repeatedly lied under oath during that hearing. He was actually called on two of those lies during the hearing, and persisted in at least one anyway. That is, as he repeatedly emphasized, a felony.

The subs weren't even banned though, all you get is a warning about their contents! These are communities who regularly demonstrate their "humour" to be blatant racism, sexism, or some form of calling for the deaths of others with no punchline to go with it, and they're not even being censored for it! 

Again, driving stuff "underground" doesn't work the way you think it does. Look at the relationship between Reddit and Voat, and what happened with 4chan and /pol/. The parts of Reddit that did get censored are now there, festering in a pool of completely unabashed white supremacy and neonaziism, but it's tiny and doesn't have a fraction of the reach Reddit has. /pol/ started out as a containment board for political "discussion" on 4chan and ended up becoming the largest board on the site, massively influencing the hateful, reactionary, and edgily inflammatory politics that is now constantly present on almost every board. There's actually a study about this that I'll reply to you with when I find it, but right now I'll just say that containment and just-leaving-them-alone doesn't work like you seem to think it does, and actively fosters indoctrination and radicalisation of the people on the platform they share. 

Keep in mind, these are not just subs which complain about taxes, or economic policy, or immigration policy, they're actively engaged in ("""ironically""") promoting violence against religious and ethnic groups. The line seems to be "no encouraging or glorifying violence or dehumanisation, especially against demographic groups", which is why /r/fullcommunism got slapped with a quarantine as well. If simply quarantining them is "the pendulum swinging too far the other way" to you, then I doubt we can ever agree.

Silence the entire human race??? A bunch of subs spreading both "ironic" and unironic white supremacism got a warning sign telling you that there are edgelords inside before you enter! Even if they did get banned, calling that "silencing the entire human race" is a massive bloody overstatement.

Like it or not, shunning people who call for genocide or reinstatement of apartheid *works*. Given how many supremacist movements work using slimy and manipulative tactics, actively stopping them from indoctrinating others is absolutely morally and ethically justifiable. Calls for violence, genocide, or attempts at dehumanisation of ethic, racial, or religious groups need to be combatted. Divisions aren't overcome by saying that the KKK are just fellow citizens and need to be heard out and respected, because they will not only radicalise the group they consider their own base, they'll send their victims towards radicals as well. Identity exists, and always will exist. People will identify with their race, their gender, their sexual orientation, their favourite brands, and their preferred pizza toppings, what needs to be prevented is supremacism and the sort of relentlessly mean spirited "ironic" edgy behaviour that the KKK themselves espouse as a great tool for indoctrination and normalisation of their views.

Obviously you ignore the right extremists. 

They're always going to exist unfortunately. Going to take a few generations to weed out.

Doesn't justify silencing the entire human race in the process. That's an OVERREACTION. 

And if you want to go down the route of hate speech inciting violence, which I'd agree with, this is the downfall of global connectivity and clashing of cultures. Our toughest battle is to come together over the coming years, diffuse as many wars as possible, and love each other. 

Sounds cheesy but I feel it's our best bet. Don't drive more separation through group identity and compelled speech.

Even IF polygraphs were reliable, in America defendants are innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law, one of our most important civil liberties. Thus the burden of proof always rests on the plaintiff, not the defendant. Unless she can prove his guilt, he has no need to prove his innocence. If there are no other witnesses or material evidence, then there is more than a reasonable doubt about her claim.

One brief note on legal procedure: 

>Innocent until proven guilty means that an accuser has to “prove” beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime has occurred.

This isn't really accurate the way you frame it. In a criminal trial, the *government* has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty in order to secure a conviction. 

But in a civil lawsuit, the accuser (the plaintiff) only has to prove that it's "more likely than not" that a harm has occurred (a "preponderance of the evidence"). 

This is why O.J. Simpson was acquitted (found not guilty) in his criminal trial but found liable in his civil trial for wrongful death. The state couldn't prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt but the victims' families proved their case by a preponderance of the evidence.

Because it isnt his duty to prove his innocence, it's the prosecutors duty to prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he's guilty. Just because the allegation is rape doesnt change how our courts function and in this country until you are proven or plead guilty you are presumed innocent in the eyes of the court.

Other than the fact that I'm making a PRINCIPLED argument and the hypothetical is falling consistently within those principles.

Guilty until proven innocent (the principle you are arguing for) would demand just that. I wonder why they don't do that??

>They, what do you call it, **investigate** to see if it's legit. It also would fall into said companies HR rules. 

It's almost like the principle of "innocent until proven guilty" exists in civilized societies outside of "trials"

>Conflating your view of innocent until proven guilty and a confirmation hearing don't make them true either. 

No, the fact that the concept is generally held in courts, confirmation hearings, and HR departments makes them true.

>The hearing is not about his guilt or innocence. As much as you keep thinking it is. It's not.

The demand that he should "prove his innocence" and the accusations appear to be enough from the left to keep him off the court is isxactly what its about.

I agree with you completely.  I hope that if your post was inspired by me saying that "he wasn't found guilty just like he wasn't found innocent" is just a  misunderstanding. 

The person I  responded to stated that Kavanaugh wasn't found guilty as evidence for his innocence. I pointed out that he wasn't found guilty or innocent because no investigation has taken place.

Unless there is any evidence to the fact (which so far, there isn't) then yes... It's worthless. We have a very high standard for criminal convictions for a reason: beyond a reasonable doubt. Unless you can meet that standard, the person accused is presumed innocent of the crime.

Really consider just how much evidence you need for something to be beyond a reasonable doubt. And then consider the evidence we have for it (so far).

Then again, if you're a spoiled man-child who's never been held accountable regardless of the amount of horrid shit you've done, this is pretty much on-par behavior. I mean, sure, there's an off-chance Kavanaugh is a decent human being, but the Duck Test says otherwise.

No, the request for an FBI investigation was and is requested because they do federal background checks, for federal offices.

It’s not the Senate’s job to perform a full investigation of the crime. Nor is it the FBI’s. It is the responsibility of the state or local authorities in Maryland after a complaint was filed. But since a complaint was never filed...yes, this was all political theater by all sides.

They weren't asking for an investigation when they got the information about the rape, they didn't ask for an investigation when they talked with Kavanaugh other times.

They're only asking for an investigation *now.* The Republicans are (rightfully) saying this is political opportunism to extend the nomination proceedings.

The Democrats didn't call for the hearing. Republicans did. 

Ford came forward prior to Kavanaugh's nomination when she heard he was on the list to her congresswoman. Ford wanted her name to be private, so Democrats sent her story to the FBI to be investigated. Republicans said an FBI investigation was not needed and we ended up with the bullshit hearing on Thursday where they refused to talk to her.

Now, because they don't have enough votes to approve him, they are allowing an FBI investigation... But it must be *one week or less*.

So that's why. There's no statute of limitations on rape in Maryland but they're trying to deny her a real investigation and trial. Idk why that's allowed.

That is not at all what I am saying.  Please, do not impose any assumptions on my statements.  There should absolutely be further investigation.  All allegations should be examined.  Sexual assault is no joke.  Neither is false accusation of such crimes.

I find, in this situation, the accusers are not credible specifically because of the FBI scrutiny he has already undergone and the lack of corroboration to any of the claims by any of the purported witnesses.

Additionally, the accusations are not within federal jurisdiction, they are state crimes.  They should be investigated by the Maryland State Bureau of Investigation.  The FBI has already failed if the accusations are true...six times.

They didn't want an investigation because the Senate judiciary committee has investigatorial powers. There are no leads to follow besides talking to the witnesses she has named, all of whom have already given sworn statements under threat of perjury that this didn't happen.

Don't take that 70% the wrong way, I suspect you misread the statement. He's not saying that 70% of cases convicted on grounds of eye witness testimonies were overturned, but rather that when DNA testing became a thing, 70% of cases *that were overturned* could at least in part be attributed to faulty eye witness testimony. 

In other words, eye witness testimony corroborates correctly in the vast majority of cases, but in old cases that had gotten it wrong, faulty testimony was a common denominator.

Why are we talking about speculation. Base your decisions on actual cold stone facts.

Can you tell me what evidence there actually is that would stick on a actual court of law? If not, then how is it a credible claim? If it was credible t would stand on any court of law. If no such claim can be made that would pass a court of law, why are we destroying a man’s career over accusations? This is not how the world should work. 

I stand by innocent until proven guilty because my family has been on the other end of these empty accusations. And they keep on even after your name has been cleared by courts. It wasn’t about sexual assault, it was about robbing the gov’t in Mexico. And yet just because of empty words, my family is known to a lot of people as thieves. Our address was publicized, and people still come around sometimes and leave nasty letters.

So you do confirm on being okay with people having their careers destroyed based on accusations with no evidence. That’s interesting.

So in other words, rape basically isn't a crime because it's impossible to provide irrefutable evidence of it in nearly all circumstances.

> Why are we talking about speculation. Base your decisions on actual cold stone facts.

I am, mate. It's a cold stone fact that people don't just lie under oath for no reason, backed up by evidence. It's a cold stone fact that there's no plausible motive for her to lie. You need to stop confusing your opinion with fact. You don't like the evidence which says it's unlikely she's lying, so you try to act like it doesn't exist.

>Can you tell me what evidence there actually is that would stick on a actual court of law? If not, then how is it a credible claim? If it was credible t would stand on any court of law.

That's not how court of laws work, mate. Court of laws determine whether there's enough evidence to prosecute someone under the law. They do not determine truth, or "credibility", or anything of the sort. This isn't a trial, this is a hearing to determine whether his character is clean. And you need to stop pretending that you won't accept any evidence that wouldn't convict him of rape in a court of law.

>I stand by innocent until proven guilty because my family has been on the other end of these empty accusations. And they keep on even after your name has been cleared by courts. It wasn’t about sexual assault, it was about robbing the gov’t in Mexico. And yet just because of empty words, my family is known to a lot of people as thieves. Our address was publicized, and people still come around sometimes and leave nasty letters.

I'm sorry that's happened to you, but you do understand that you're revealing your personal bias? A bad thing happened to you, so you assume that all people who make accusations are liars.

For someone who says they base their opinions on "cold stone facts", that's not very rational.

Has she made any monetary gains from this ordeal? That’s a motive. How about just getting more attention? People lie all the time to get attention, that’s another. 

But all of this is just speculation. I like to make my decisions and opinions based on facts. And the favts are that there is no evidence for these accusations. 

Can you confirm that what you’re saying is that you’re okay with destroying a man’s career over accusations with no evidence to support those claims?

You missed what they were saying.

Witness testimony or the accusers testimony on its own is usually worthless without any corroborating evidence. 

Ie if you accuse someone of a crime, that accusation means jack unless you can also prove they were in the area, you have physical evidence of the crime in relation to the accused, etc.

Its not a issue of strength unless multiple people witnessed the crime, but even then if someone has a alibi with multiple other witnesses it's still useless. 

So basically, yes, witness testimony is general useless in the absence of other evidence.

No youre the victim, not a witness lol. You're abusing semantics here. The victim *claims* to have witnessed the crime. That unto itself can't be evidence, as the simply accusing someone of a crime isn't evidence of said crime. Witness statements are collected from people who *weren't* the accuser nor the accused, stating that they witnessed/observed the crime take place. This, if those witnesses are proven to have no ulterior motive, can be used as evidence. Obviously a victim of a crime witnessed that crime, but that's not the same as being a viable witness.

I absolutely didn’t miss any of that, I was pointing out the complete absurdity of saying that witness testimony “isn’t evidence.”

Because, again, it is. And also, a huge amount of the time, crimes don’t have any evidence other than one person’s word against another person’s. If Person A punches Person B, and there’s no security camera around to record it, the police aren’t going to refuse to arrest Person A if Person B goes to the police and says that he’s been punched by Person A. And then, considering that the vast majority of cases end in plea deals (roughly 95%), that’s usually the end of case.

If testimony can't be corroborated it is usually thrown out. Ie it ceases to be evidence.

The case you are describing would use physical evidence such as a wound or other physical sign of the attack as evidence to corroberate the testimony along with the alleged motive, physical location of the accused during the attack, etc. 

You believe your scenario, with ONLY unsubstantiated claims by a single individual would end in a plea? In what century? Even the lowest tier public defender could question that out of court.

Mate you should get your definitions right. Because she is a first hand witness, it is neither speculation nor hearsay. Hearsay is something that is not within the personal knowledge of the subject, as in it would be hearsay if it was her husband testifying to it on her behalf. But because it is her personal, direct experience, it is evidence. Testimony is evidence of a crime, and can be used to garner convictions without forensic evidence.

They would be admissible as evidence against her if she were accused of a crime. Otherwise, her testimony to anyone other than an officer the law is hearsay.

So when an alleged rape victim gets something wrong in their testimony, does it mean they made it all up? Or is it just that they don't actually have superhuman memory?

It's not a compliment at all, it's an implied phrase "Obama is articulate for a black man".  The racist speaker just says "Obama is articulate" and the racist listener hears "Obama is a black man".  It has no bearing on his speech it's just an appeal to racist feelings.  This is dogwhistling, and should be called out and shamed.

Dominant males would describe Kavanaugh's erratic behavior as a sign of strenght and confidence. If the same behavior were to be exhibited by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford she would be deemed hysterical and a drama queen, even crazy.

Even the privilege to act like an asshole on national TV is gendered.

Nah, sorry. Dominant males are uncomfortable with and dismissive of emotional displays and vulnerability. They would most definitely eviscerate him for this behavior if he was a Democrat.

Testerical is the male analog: Overly aggressive, irritable, or unreasonable, as from being overwhelmed by testosterone.

In other words, Kavanaugh's behavior during his testimony.

Again it is a double standard.  Hysterical man - strong and defending his honor.  Hysterical women - weak and probably trying get sympathy fro something she did to herself.

That is a double standard and it just sucks to be called on it.

No man or woman should ever act like that if they are to hold office. He was called hysterical to juxtapose the reaction towards someone doing the same action if they were a woman.

The double standard is him acting like he did and getting a pass.

No we wouldn't. It is a sign of fear and insecurity. A 'dominant' male is calm and confident. He was not. He was like an scared little yappy dog who is acting tough. 

But yes a woman would be judged much more harshly for behaving like he did.
